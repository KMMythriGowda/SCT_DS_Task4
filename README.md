## Objective
To analyze a real-world **Road Traffic Accident (RTA) dataset** and identify patterns related to accident frequency, severity, and contributing factors such as **time, weather, and road conditions**. This helps in **improving road safety and planning preventive measures**.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive analysis

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Checked and handled **missing values**.
- Converted **date and time columns** to datetime format.
- Standardized **categorical variables**.
- Removed **duplicates**.
- Created new features like `Hour` from time and `Month` from date.

## Analysis & Insights
- Accident frequency **peaks during evening hours**.
- **Wet and foggy weather** contributes to more accidents.
- Certain road types (like **single carriageways**) have higher accident rates.
- Accident severity is higher during **night-time and poor light conditions**.

## Results
- Identified **high-risk time periods and weather conditions**.
- Pinpointed road types with **higher accident likelihood**.
- Insights can help improve **road safety measures and emergency response planning**.
